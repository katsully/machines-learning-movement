# DecisionTreeToCpp converter allows you to export and use sklearn decision tree in your C++ projects
# It can be useful if you want only to use decision rules produced by powerful and simple scikit 
# (you can easy create and test different models, but compile only the best one)
# 
# This code was written as a modification of Daniele's answer in StackOverflow topic "how to extract the decision rules from scikit-learn decision-tree"
